Poseidon (code name) is my first big Unity project.
It's a 2D platforming roguelite, taking inspiration from Spelunky and Metroid.
Visit the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/05wTmQpr/poseidon) to watch my development progress!
Play the WebGL build [here](http://oh-petya.github.io/poseidon/)!
* Current focus is on nailing down character movement and controls.
