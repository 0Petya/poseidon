Poseidon (code name) is my first big Unity project.
It's a 2D platforming roguelite, taking inspiration from Spelunky and Metroid.
Visit the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/05wTmQpr/poseidon) to watch my development progress!

To give it a roll, download [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) and import the project folder.
